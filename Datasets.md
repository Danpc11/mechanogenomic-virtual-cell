## Datasets

This project integrates three publicly available human liver RNA-seq datasets from the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO):

- [GSE130970](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE130970)
- [GSE135251](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE135251)
- [GSE162694](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE162694)

All datasets are derived from snap-frozen human liver biopsies and span the full fibrosis
spectrum, including histologically normal controls (N) and fibrosis stages F1–F4. The
dominant disease etiology across cohorts is NAFLD/NASH-associated fibrosis.

## Conceptual framework: hepatocyte nuclear mechanics across fatty liver fibrosis

### From fatty liver to nuclear mechanotransduction

This project is based on a hepatocyte-centered mechanobiological framework that links fatty
liver disease progression to nuclear deformation and transcriptional reprogramming.
 
#### **Healthy liver / Steatosis (N–F1)**

• Soft extracellular matrix 
• Low actomyosin tension 
• Rounded, compliant hepatocyte nucleus 
• Open chromatin organization 
• Predominantly metabolic transcriptional programs

#### **Progressive NASH (F2)**

• Initiation of ECM remodeling (collagen deposition, LOX activity) 
• Increased cytoskeletal tension and force transmission 
• Partial nuclear deformation 
• Chromatin reorganization and stress sensitivity 
• Mixed metabolic and inflammatory transcriptional programs 

#### **Advanced fibrosis (F3–F4)**

• Stiff, collagen-rich fibrotic matrix
• High mechanical load transmitted to the nucleus
• Flattened and strained hepatocyte nuclei
• Nuclear lamina stress and chromatin compaction
• Activation of mechanosensitive transcriptional programs
(ECM remodeling, cytoskeleton, YAP/TAZ–TEAD, survival pathways)


In early disease stages, hepatocytes experience lipid accumulation in a mechanically
compliant environment. Nuclear shape remains largely isotropic and gene expression is
dominated by metabolic programs.

As fibrosis progresses, ECM stiffening increases actomyosin-generated forces transmitted to
the nucleus via integrin–cytoskeleton–LINC complexes. At intermediate stages, chromatin
organization becomes mechanically sensitive.
